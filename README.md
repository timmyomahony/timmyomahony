### Hi there 👋

I'm an independent Irish software developer helping tech-constrained teams pitch & deliver more ambitious apps and experiences.

On the tech side, I'm a full-stack developer with 10+ years of experience delivering fully-formed webs apps, from dynamic and interactive  frontend projects to data-centric backends.
